# Books Project

Welcome to the Books project! This Django application is designed to manage a collection of books and includes features for RESTful API endpoints, testing, and development utilities.

## Features

- **Auto-generated Documentation**: Automatically generate documentation for Django REST Framework using **drf-spectacular**.
- **Next Generation Python Manager**: Leverage **uv** for running Django management commands efficiently.
- **Simplified Management**: Utilize a **Makefile** to streamline common tasks and commands.
- **pgAdmin Web App**: Includes a web interface for managing PostgreSQL databases with pgAdmin.


## Project Settings

- **Django Application Name**: `books`
- **Django Management Command**: `uv run manage.py`

## Dependencies
### Uv
I'm using the nex gen package and project manager for python [Uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
To be able to run app without docker I need to install the UV.
```bash
pip install uv
```
### Django dependencies:

- **Core Dependencies**:
  - `django`: The web framework for building the application.
  - `django-filter`: A package for filtering querysets.
  - `djangorestframework`: Toolkit for building Web APIs.
  - `drf-spectacular`: For generating OpenAPI 3 schemas.
  - `psycopg2-binary`: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
  - `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from `.env` files.

- **Development Dependencies**:
  - `faker`: A library for generating fake data.
  - `pytest`: A testing framework.
  - `pytest-django`: A plugin for integrating pytest with Django.

## Makefile Commands

This project includes a Makefile for easier management of common tasks. Here are the available commands:

### Available Commands:

- `make run-dev`: Run the development server.
- `make migrate`: Apply database migrations locally for SQLite.
- `make makemigrations`: Create new migrations based on model changes.
- `make shell`: Open the Django shell.
- `make test`: Run the project tests.

### Docker Commands:
- `make run-watch`: Run the development server inside a Docker container with file watching enabled.
- `make run-prod`: Run the production server using Docker.
- `make stop`: Stop the Docker containers.
- `make test-postgres`: Run tests in a Docker container with PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nbowisdar/Django-Books
cd Django-Books
```

* Without Docker:
    ```bash
    # Install uv
    pip install uv
    
    # Apply migrations
    make migrate

    # Start server
    make run-dev
    ```

* With Docker:
    ```bash
    make run-watch - For dev only.
    make run-prod - For prod.
    ```

## Testing
It's also 2 way of testing.

1. With Postgres and with Docker
    ```bash
    make test-postgres
    ```

2. With SQLite and without Docker
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
3. Also this is possible to generate dummy books for testing purposes. 
    ```bash
    uv run manage.py generate_books
    ``` 
Note.

I haven't configured a full production setup with Nginx, Traefik, Gunicorn, and separate settings to keep the focus on Django REST Framework rather than on DevOps concerns."
